### Hello World! üëã

I am Sriram Srinivasan, Graduate Student at University of Texas at Dallas majoring in Information Technology & Management with specializations in Database and Intelligent Systems. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in Database Foundations, Data Visualization, Advanced Statistics, Data Warehousing.

üíª My technical prowess spans a diverse range of tools and languages, including SQL, MS Excel, Tableau, Python, MongoDB, ETL pipelines, Power BI, Git, and Jira. Certified in Tableau Fundamentals and Data Engineering from Datacamp and experienced in Case Study analysis, I bring hands-on expertise in extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets.

üåê During my tenure at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Limited as a System Engineer for Citibank NA, I developed data pipelines using the Ab Initio tool. These pipelines were designed to ensure that when data is loaded into the database, the necessary transformations and data cleaning are performed before the final loading. Working with large volumes of raw data provided me with valuable insights into data management and processing for real-time applications. Additionally, I developed generic Unix scripts to automate file transfers to various servers worldwide. This project also involved creating jobs in the AutoSys tool to schedule and trigger these scripts at specified intervals. Automating these processes significantly reduced manual effort, which would otherwise be tedious and time-consuming. My technical and problem-solving skills were critical in delivering the expected results, leading to my receiving the ‚ÄúOn the Spot‚Äù award for my persistent and diligent efforts to meet high targets and complete the project ahead of schedule.

üöÄ Beyond the corporate realm, I have undertaken multiple projects that showcase a diverse range of technical skills and expertise. One notable project involved building a data pipeline for a system called Gym Buddy. This project utilized various technologies such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Mage, and Python. Through this experience, I gained a deep understanding of cloud computing, data integration, and the efficient processing of datasets.
Another significant project highlighted my proficiency in data visualization. I built comprehensive Tableau Dashboards, which effectively communicated complex data insights through intuitive and interactive visual representations. Additionally, I collaborated on a project that focused on predicting a currency's country and denomination based on its image. This project showcased my knowledge of machine learning, particularly in the field of computer vision.
